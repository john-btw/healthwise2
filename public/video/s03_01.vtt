00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Before travelling, try to understand arrival procedures at your destination airport.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Also arrange your meet and greet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you know where you are going you will look confident and purposeful.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Have paperwork ready (be discreet with plans & information), 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and always be polite with officials.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000
As you enter the arrivals hall, look confident.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Quickly scan and find your sign.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Insist that no more than your surname is on this sign. Be discreet.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Confirm your driver’s identity. Ask questions, if in doubt, call the car company.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500
If you don’t see your name, walk confidently to a quiet spot 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
and call the car company or the driver.
