00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.500
The majority of travellers’ diarrhoea 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500
is caused by ingesting faecal matter through food, water and dirty hands.  

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Food is best cooked to order. Avoid pre-prepared food or buffets. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Select popular busy outlets. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Vegetarian food is often safer than meat.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Avoid shellfish, salads, ice cream or unpeelable fruits and vegetables. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Boil it, peel it, cook it, or forget it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Drink and brush teeth with bottled water. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Avoid ice and local drinks that aren’t boiled.  

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, and consider a 60% alcohol gel.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Symptoms of travellers’ diarrhoea can include 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
nausea, abdominal cramps, fever and vomiting.  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The most debilitating effects of travellers’ diarrhoea are caused by dehydration. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You must replace body fluids by drinking safe water.  

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Use rehydration salts or make your own. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Any safe liquid is OK, but avoid caffeine, alcohol and dairy.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When you feel ready, eat bland foods. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Avoid grease and dairy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If you are worried call your emergency contact,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
especially if you see blood or it doesn’t go away in 3 days.  

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Travellers’ diarrhoea is the body getting rid of bugs, and is a good thing.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Avoid blocking drugs, unless you have no choice.
