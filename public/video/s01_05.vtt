00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.500
Most criminals are rational people who want to go home after their day’s work.  

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.500
They are looking for easy targets.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Travellers are likely to carry items of value, whether visible or not.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.500
They are easy to identify,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.500
and less likely to be aware of local scams.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.500
Travellers are unlikely to stay to help police in a detailed investigation.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
The criminal is looking for vulnerabilities: 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
items left unattended,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.500
busy areas,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.500
real or self-made distractions,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
fake distractions.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Physical vulnerability is also an important factor,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.500
as is body language – so don’t let your guard down.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
With this knowledge of how criminals target people, 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
do an honest appraisal of your strengths and weaknesses 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and plan your trip accordingly.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Always remain vigilant when travelling, awareness and confidence look alike.
