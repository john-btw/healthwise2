Information technology is a vital corporate asset and should be protected at all times.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.500
However, when travelling we face additional risks and the following are some tips 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500
to protect yourself and the company from criminals.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Before travelling,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
ensure you understand your IT security policy and how to access further support, if required.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.500
If you are travelling to a high-risk country where your data might be stolen,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.000
you may have to take clean or loan devices and consider extra precautions like privacy screens.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.500
Loaner devices mean your usual device is not exposed to risk.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Leave all non-essential devices at home,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
such as personal tablets and e-readers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
Remove any sensitive data from your devices, 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.000
and clear your history and recycle bin before you depart.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Update software for all devices and apps.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Turn off wireless and Bluetooth when you are not using them, and enable screen lock.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Be aware that the types of luggage you travel with could advertise 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.500
your valuable devices to criminals, such as laptop bags.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000
If you aren't using your device, power it down.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This optimises encryption software performance.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you must carry sensitive information with you,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
always carry it in your hand luggage.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Always be discreet when working in public places. You never know who is watching.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.500
Use a privacy screen.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.000
Never leave any of your devices or luggage unattended.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Always connect using a VPN,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
then tether your phone.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Public Wi-Fi should be avoided without a VPN.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Check Wi-Fi network name is correct and if you must use public Wi-Fi,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
never install software to go online.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
If your device is lost or stolen,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
report it immediately to your IT department and manager.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500
Or, if you observe anything suspicious, 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
or suspect devices have been compromised while travelling,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.000
turn off for the rest of the trip,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and immediately report it to IT upon your return.
