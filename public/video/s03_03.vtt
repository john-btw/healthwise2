00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.000
Criminals lurk in lobbies. Donâ€™t let anyone hear your room number.  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Check the door has a deadbolt and peephole,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the windows lock,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
there are no adjoining room doors,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or connected balconies.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Check the safe is secure and works,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
and that there's a smoke and fire detector.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Before settling in, read the fire plan. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Walk the route to the exit and count the doors 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
along the way to act as a guide in poor visibility.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500
Check it opens.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
When in your room use the deadlock, 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
and a door wedge for added security. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Unless you are expecting someone, do not open your door.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Check with reception and arrange to meet any visitors there.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
At night, keep your grab bag ready to go.
