00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Laws and attitudes towards women around the world 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
can vary from those in your home country.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
Some countries and cultures may have different etiquettes 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
on how men and women greet each other.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Women in senior roles may be less common in the workplace.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.250
Working practices and the way staff interact may be different to your home office.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.000
Women travellers may be perceived as an easier target,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and therefore be at an increased risk of petty crime.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They are also more likely to experience

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.250
 unwanted attention, sexual harassment or assault.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.000
If you feel uncomfortable, move to a safer place or signal for help.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Good research and preparation can help you mitigate your risk.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500
What cultural or safety differences might there be?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
Use multiple sources and seek advice and recommendations 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
from friends and colleagues, especially other women.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Consider bringing these items.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When used appropriately they can help deter unwanted attention:

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
A simple wedding band.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.500
Sunglasses to stop unwanted eye contact.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
A personal alarm.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.750
A shawl and long-sleeved top (to cover your shoulders, arms, or hair, as maybe required).

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.000
When travelling, make it seem like you are in a group.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.500
Make a call to let someone know you will be arriving shortly.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Even a pretend call can be better than nothing.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.250
Ask for a table for two, and place a coat over the second chair.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.000
Don't let them clear the second place setting,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to make it seem like you're already with, or expecting someone.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
See how local women appear in public and try to blend in.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Increase your safety by looking confident and watching your surroundings.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you are concerned, go to a safe place and seek help. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.750
If you don't speak the local language, 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.000
phrase books and translation apps can help you communicate.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In some countries, victims of crime can be treated as offenders.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Seek guidance from your embassy before reporting any incidents.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Most business trips go without a hitch, 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.500
and these suggestions should give you extra peace of mind.
