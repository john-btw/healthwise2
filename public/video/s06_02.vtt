00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.750
LGBTQ+ rights have come a long way in many parts of the world.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.250
However in some regions and countries this is not the case.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.000
Homosexuality may be illegal,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or not culturally accepted or tolerated.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sometimes the authorities won't help you,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
if they share these biased views.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Good research and preparation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
can help to mitigate the risk.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Try to understand the local culture.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.250
All travellers should keep a low profile, so as not to draw attention to themselves.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.250
Use multiple sources and seek advice and recommendations from friends and colleagues,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.000
especially those who are also part of the LGBTQ+ community.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
LGBTQ+ travellers have been targeted and entrapped,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.250
so make your social media profiles private,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.250
and on mobile devices consider hiding certain lifestyle or dating apps.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
Password protect your devices,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.250
and stop messages showing on locked screen.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.000
When socialising, be mindful of certain colleagues or clients,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.250
especially if drinking!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.250
If you don't have experience of your destination,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.000
take extra precautions if travelling with your partner.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Hotel staff may take offence and report you.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Transgender travellers should ensure their legal identity and documentation match their gender.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you are detained by the police you must

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.250
insist on being able to contact your embassy.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.750
Do not give out your phone password,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.750
or admit to or sign anything,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.000
without trusted legal representation.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Before travelling, check what support your company will give you, if you are at risk.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.000
Most business trips go without a hitch, and this advice should help keep you safer.
