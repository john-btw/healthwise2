00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.000
International and domestic travel can bring us to security and safety environments 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.500
that are different from our home cities.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.750
Many factors determine your individual risk-profile, 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.500
including race, religion, and ethnicity.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Skin colour can be a factor that changes each person's experience of travelling.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For example, in some regions, persons of colour may attract negative attention

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or face discrimination and hostility in day-to-day activities.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In other regions, those with white skin or particular hair colours 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
may attract unwanted, and disruptive attention.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Often this attention is simple curiosity or interest and, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
while it may be uncomfortable, is not likely to be a threat.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
However, trust your instinct; if the attention feels hostile or aggressive, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
find a safe place to ask for help.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Local law enforcement is not the only option, 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and in some places they might ignore your plight.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.500
Hotels, restaurants, banks and offices are often safe spaces 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.000
where you can seek help, or make a phone-call.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Sometimes, when making reservations, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a traveller's name may be unfairly discriminated against, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
if it suggests a particular ethnicity or religion.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Including your title and the company's name on your booking has been shown to help.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Persons of colour are more likely to have their credentials checked by security, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
when entering hotels or office spaces.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Having a hard copy of your itinerary, or a business card, 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
can help to speed up the process.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Particular dress or appearance can even lead to extra checks or delays, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in places where security is especially strict.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
In some locations, persons of certain races, religions or ethnicities, 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000
may be subject to additional security checks in places like airports.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Extra time may be needed to allow for screening and clear the security areas.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Additionally, not all regions are tolerant of all religions or faiths, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and can increase the risk of unwanted attention in day-to-day life.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
Doing some extra research on safe and welcoming spaces 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
can help your trip go more smoothly.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Travelling is usually an exciting and rewarding experience, 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but include researching specific information about 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
racial, religious, or ethnic discrimination before you travel.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.500
If you have any questions or concerns, 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000
speak to your manager, HR, or your diversity network.
