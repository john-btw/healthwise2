00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.500
Situational awareness is how to read your surroundings to help keep you safe

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.500
from incidents, including accidents, crime and terrorism.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Understand that bad things can happen anywhere, even in low risk locations,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500
and acknowledge they could happen to you.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
It is more a mindset than a skill, everyone can do it.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.500
In fact we all do, everyday, not just during travel.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Preparation is essential for good situational awareness.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Try to understand what risks you may face and research how to deal with them.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.000
Find out if there are unsafe areas, then study the layout of your destination. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500
Use online maps.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Where will you be going and where are the unsafe areas?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Plan your routes, stick to main roads, avoid shortcuts.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Think where you can get help. Identify safe locations.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.500
What do you need with you? Leave unnecessary items behind.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.500
What are you showing to strangers such as company logos or valuable items.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Do you blend in?

00:01:16.500--> 00:01:21.500
Are you setting patterns that make you predictable?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.500
When in public pay attention. You need to use your eyes and ears,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
so don't wear your headphones, and look up and over the shoulder of the person in front.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.500
When walking, don't look at the soles of feet of the person in front of you, or your phone screen.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Monitor your route. Look at people, around people and objects, check reflections.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Try to understand what should be normal.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.500
In this scene you would expect to see passengers, guards, cleaners.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500
But these characters might raise alarm bells.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Look and listen for anything out of place.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Trust your instincts. If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Without staring, observe people's body language.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Do they look relaxed or tense? Is their pose threatening?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Read their mood from their eyes.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.500
People know when you have seen them, know you are alert, and look for an easier target.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.500
Consider your location. If static - do you have good visibility

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.500
in all directions and is your back protected? 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.500
If moving, is it well lit, is there help nearby, are there escape routes?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.500
Remember to use your ears.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.500
React immediately to any threat, and move away from source. Orientate yourself to the danger.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Where are other people moving?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500
Remember to trust your instincts.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
If you sense, or feel threatened, do something:

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.500
Check behind you, go back the way you came, cross the road, 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500
join other people, enter a safe location.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Reassess your situation.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Are you safe?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500
Get out of danger.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.000
Applying these tips will improve your situational awareness, 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
giving you better defence against most threats, keeping you safer.
